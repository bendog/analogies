# Analogies

Weird analogies I've come up with while teaching Python

## Functions are like contractors

**Functions are like contractors, they might do the same task, but once they're done they pack up and leave.**

Like your uber drivers all do the same task, but if you have a good chat to one driver about cats, the next driver wont know what you talked about.

## Functions inherit variables from parents

**Children inherit their parents genes, parents don't inherit the genes of their children.**

A function will know the values of the variables set in the main (global/parent) part of your script, but the variables set in the function (child) will only be known to the child.
